                <h2>Green Salad</h2>
                <p>Green Salad is one of our popular healthy veggie item. It has tomato, avacado, pumpkin, chick peas,
                    cabbage, lettuce etc. Then we top it off with our special sauce. </p>

                <h2>Pumpkin Soup</h2>
                <p>This is a delicious pumpkin soup with just enough spice for a mild kick. It's made
                    with coconut oil instead of butter and uses light coconut milk in place of milk or cream. It's a
                    great starter still quite filling.</p>

                <p><b>Review:</b> This is my first time trying here. Didn't have much expectation but it's actually
                    yummy! The
                    fruits
                    were fresh and i customized my order. Not much filling but must try with their smoothie. Perfect for
                    breakfast. </p>

                <h4>Rating: 4.0/5.0</h4>
                <p><b>Review:</b> Firstly I thought they were a veg food chain but I was wrong. So, I tried their
                    Japanese Seared Steak. Ordered medium rare received slightly over-cooked one. But it's juicy, had
                    perfect amount of
                    tender chewiness. Good ambience also. But there's always room for improvement. Best of luck.</p>

                <h4>Rating: 4.5/5.0</h4>
                <p><b>Review:</b> I've recently shifted to being vegetarian. Was looking for good veg items. My friend
                    suggested food network's mixed veg salad. And I'm impressed! It was delicious. The amount of sauce
                    was perfect. But try changing the veg items, will bring variation. Must recommended.</p>
